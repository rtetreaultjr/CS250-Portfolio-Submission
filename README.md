When working on development, one of the most important objectives comes down to understanding the needs of the user. Making a user story, where you create a workable backlog item from needs of the consumer, helps by giving an achievable goal that adds value to the product being iterated. By using agile for developing programs in a group setting, one is able to have clearly defined roles for members of the team such as the product owner, scrum master, and developer. The focus on achieving rapid, working iterations allows for feedback to be worked into future iterations, which is something that is valuable in developing software regardless of if it is in a group setting or not. Having broad knowledge in each facet of software development ensures that I would be a productive member of the team, regardless of what I am working on.
